I graduated in December 2022 from the University of Pennsylvania with a masterâ€™s degree in Computer and Information Technology (MCIT) and completed additional graduate level computer science courses at Stanford. I am seeking to combine my scientific and educational experiences with my deepening understanding of technology to join a development team.",
            "Since enrolling in the MCIT program, I have gained valuable experience and technical skills in distributed systems, databases, computer networks, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data, cloud computing, and web applications. My passion for user-centered design and clean/maintainable code elevates my projects to the next level. ",
            "I have also completed a PhD at Stanford University in Oceanography as a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow, where I designed, implemented, and managed complex projects through completion. My research focused on the carbon system in the Ross Sea, Antarctica, which involved collaborative research cruises, computer modelling, and analyzing large satellite-derived and oceanographic datasets. I also designed and built autonomous instruments for ocean acidification research on coral reefs.",
