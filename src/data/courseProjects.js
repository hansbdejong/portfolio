            "Data Compression — Created an end-to-end compression and decompression tool in C++ that employs Huffman coding to optimally compress data.",
            "A.I. Fanfiction Text Generator  — Created Python text generator that takes in a corpus of text and implements n-gram model to generate text of chosen length.",
            "Traffic Sign Classifier — Classified images of traffic signs into 43 categories with MxNet using Convolutional Neural Networks with 85% accuracy.",
            "Control Hijacking — Identified security vulnerabilities in code (including buffer overflow, double free, and format string vulnerabilities) and wrote exploits that executed the vulnerable program with a crafted argument, causing the program to jump to an exploit string.",
            "Web Security — Constructed attacks against a web application (cookie theft, cross-site request forgery, session hijacking, SQL injection, profile worm, password extraction via timing attack) and then updated the application to defend against those attacks.",
            "Network Security — Programmatically analyzed a packet capture file using Golang to identify port scanning and ARP spoofing. Implemented a DNS spoofer that hijacks a HTTP connection.",
            "Social Media Post Analyzer — Applied N-tier architecture to develop Java program that analyzed files of social media posts to identify posts discussing a certain key word, associate those posts with their nearest location, and identify what locations are “hotspots” based on the volume of posts associated with that location.",
            "Sudoku Solver — Created Python sudoku solver utilizing a version of the AC-3 algorithm improved through use of inference, guessing, and recursive backtracking.",
            "Boggle Solver — Built C++ program that finds all valid words on a boggle board using recursive backtracking.  ",
            "Sorting Algorithms — Implemented Merge Sort and QuickSort algorithms with Linked Lists in C++.",
            "Single-Player Game Suite — Implemented Tower Blaster, Pig, and Lunar Lander in Python as well as Blackjack Solitaire, Battleship, Breakout, and “Evil” Hangman in Java. Learned and applied key software design concepts including class structure design, documentation, and unit testing.",
            "Machine Code Assembler/Dis-assembler — Wrote C libraries to translate Assembly language to binary and vice-versa.",
