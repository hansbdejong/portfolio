            "I conceptualized and created a virtual classroom resource where students explore peer-reviewed datasets to deepen their understanding of the global carbon cycle on timescales ranging from days (coral reef metabolism) to years (atmospheric and oceanographic carbon dioxide cycles) to hundreds of thousands of years (carbon dioxide trapped in ice cores). I built these interactive data visualizations using Dygraphs, D3.js, and Leaflet.",
